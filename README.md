Hi!
This is an exercise done during the odin project. (check it out here: https://www.theodinproject.com/ )
The purpose of this exercise was to practise CSS, mostly grid functionality.
This website was made for desktop and is not responsive. It was not meant to be, because it is only an exercise for me.
